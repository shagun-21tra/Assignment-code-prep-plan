Title: L0 - Understanding Global and Function Execution Context

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating two functions, one in the global execution context and another inside a function context. In this problem, you need to:

Define a global variable age.
Create a function displayAge that prints the value of the age variable.
Call the displayAge function to show how the global execution context works.
Additionally, create another function changeAge that updates the global age variable within the function, and print the value of age after updating it.

Steps:

Declare a global variable age and assign a value to it.

Create a function displayAge that logs the value of age.

Create a second function changeAge, which changes the value of age.

Call displayAge and changeAge and check how the value of age is updated.
